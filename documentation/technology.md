## Technology Policy

Link1 Studios policy is to use the latest technologies and best practices. However, the software is still in the development phase, so some technologies may be changed in the future. 
It is imperative to not download unnecesary packages and dependencies. This will keep the software light and fast. It's always better to have a custom solution than a library.
